PROJECT OVERVIEW

Lambda function behind an API gateway that should be able to increment on each visit of a domain.  Multiple users should not impact this.  

The entire environment should be created via CloudFormation.


DynamoDB: Single table with single key that contains a integer value.
Lambda:  Lambda will grab from DynamoDB table an entry that hosts a value.  On each request for the value, we return the value and then increment the value before Lambda finishes execution.
    Role:  Role will need permissions to read and write from DynamoDB.
    Code:  Get the value from the table -> Return value -> Increment value -> Save value in DynamoDB.
API Gateway: Gateway will expose a speciifc endpoint that triggers this Lambda function.  This path will be exposed to Route 53 Alias record.
Route 53: Domain that directs traffic to the API gateway.  
S3:  May be necessary to store some index.html or basic webpage information in a bucket.  S3 Single Zone most likely.
